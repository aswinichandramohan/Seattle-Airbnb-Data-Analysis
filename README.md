# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

## Introduction
Airbnb is a vacation rental online marketplace. It acts as a broker receiving commissions from host and the guests from each booking. Airbnb charges 3% from the hosts and 6% -12% depend on the type of booking from the guests. The price differs according to city, area, neighborhood.

I have done my project in the city called Seattle where I live which in Washington state. 

## Objectives
The aim of the project is to determine how the property listing of Airbnb in Seattle depends on.
1. Determining the average price on each property with respective to number of listing in each neighbourhood, number of reviews, number of beds and property type(Apartment, House, Townhouse, Condominium etc).
2. Top 5 neighbourhood having maximum price
3. Average revenue in each neighbourhoods
4. The Average availability of top 5 neighbourhood per year
5. Number of listings based on the property type 
6. How is the growth of Airbnb listings in each year

## Dataset
Dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle.

The dataset consists of 3 tables (listings, calendar, and reviews). The data set describes the listing activity and metrics in Seattle from 2008 to 2015. It includes information about hosts, area, reviews, rating, room type etc.

## Analyzing the dataset
I used Power BI business intelligence tool to analyse the data set to gain deep insights on different Airbnb properties in Seattle.

### Determining the average price on each property
There are three room types available in Seattle.
Entire home
Private room
Shared room

#### Finding 1: Average price on each room type:
```
Entire home: $155.84
Private room: $75.04
Shared room: $47.55
```

#### Finding 2: Top 5 neighbourhood having highest number of reviews:
```
Broadway - 8312
Belltown - 4439
Fremont - 4014
Wallingford - 3788
First Hill - 2358
```

#### Finding 3: Top 5 neighbourhood having highest number of Airbnb property listings:
```
Belltown - 7639
Central Business District - 3978
Broadway - 2188
University District - 1643
Wallingford - 1274
```

From the graphs, the average price of a listing doesn’t depend on the combination of neighborhoods and number of reviews.

### The top 5 most expensive neighbourhoods listings:

#### Finding 1: Top 5 neighbourhoods having highest maximum price:
```
Roosevelt - $1,000
Belltown - $999
West Queen Anne - $975 
Southeast Magnolia - $950
Westlake - $775
```

According to the map, It is very clear that the most expensive listings are in the most prime neighborhoods and closer to downtown. Roosevelt has the highest maximum price of 1000 dollars

### The average revenue of listings in each neighbourhood area

#### Finding 1: Top 5 Airbnb properties which can bring the highest revenue are
```
Broadway - $3,068,138
Central Business District - $1,179,249
Belltown - $1,153,043
Fremont - $966,833
First Hill - $952,564
```

Broadway fetches the Airbnb’s highest revenue in Seattle 

### The Average availability of top 5 neighbourhood per year

#### Finding 1: The top 5 neighbourhood having maximum number of availability:
```
Holly park - 354
Roxhill - 348
High Point - 344
Highland Park - 319
Briarcliff - 315
```

From the map, it is more evident that the maximum number of availability totally depends on least popular neighbourhood which is away from the downtown.

### Number of listings based on the property type 
There are many property types mentioned in the data sets.
Here I am taking four popular property type:
Apartments
Condominium
House

### How is the growth of Airbnb listings in each year

![Page6 screenshot](/images/Page6.JPG)

The datasets I took is from the year 2008 to 2015. 2008 is the year Airbnb started.
From the graph, it showed the growth of Airbnb property listings. The number of listings have got increased every year.
I also have a graph showing the total listing count based on room type(Entire Home, Private room, Shared room). In that we could see the growth of listing apartments is more each year.
